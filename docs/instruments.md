# Instruments

Laser Studio can control various kind of instruments of a test bench:

- {doc}`camera`
- {doc}`stage`
- {ref}`lasers_probes:lasers`
- {ref}`lasers_probes:probes`

In order to use them, a {doc}`conf_file` is loaded at startup.

```{toctree}
:hidden:
conf_file
camera
stage
lasers_probes
```
