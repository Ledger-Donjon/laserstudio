Installation
------------

Laser Studio needs an environment with Python 3.9+, and some common package.

It is commonly used on Ubuntu 22.04 and macOS, but should also run on Windows.

You can get Laser Studio installed on your computer by using ``pip``:

.. code-block:: sh

    python3 -m pip install laserstudio

After installing the application and get your configuration file ready, Laser
Studio can be run as a python module with following command:

.. code-block:: sh

    python3 -m laserstudio
