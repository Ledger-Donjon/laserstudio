# Welcome to Laser Studio's documentation!

Laser Studio is an open source tool developed by the Product Security Team of Ledger, the Donjon.

Its main usage is to have a visual representation of a spatial environment,
define zones of interest, and launch an automated scanning process by
controlling instruments of a hardware evaluation test bench.

This scanning process permits to move physically and randomly through these zones,
by controlling motion devices.

Camera and stages (or actuators) are used to synchronize the spatial positioning of
elements permitting to conduct the hardware evaluation: injection probes, laser beam...
on devices under test.
