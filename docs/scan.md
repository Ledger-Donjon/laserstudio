moving operations in order to position an element of the bench to a point of interest.

Press the SHIFT key while dragging to specify a rectangle that will be removed from the scanning zone.

Each time the scanning zone is modified, the scan path is re-generated and
updated in the Viewer to show the 10 first points.

## Go Next command

It can also be triggered thanks to the REST API.
